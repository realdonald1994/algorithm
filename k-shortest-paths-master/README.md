# k-shortest-paths
A collection of algorithms (including Yen, Eppstein, and Lazy Eppstein) to compute the K shortest paths between two nodes in a weighted, directed graph, implemented in Java.

Yen's algorithm computes loop-less paths only while Eppstein's algorithm computes paths with and without loops.

See the test code under edu/ufl/cise/bsmock/graph/ksp/test/ for example usage.
